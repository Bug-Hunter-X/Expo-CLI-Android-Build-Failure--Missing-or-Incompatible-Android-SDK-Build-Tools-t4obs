The solution involves verifying the Android SDK installation and ensuring that the necessary build tools and environment variables are correctly set.  Here's how you can approach this:

1. **Update your Android SDK:** Use the Android SDK Manager to update your Android SDK to the latest version. Make sure that you have the necessary build tools installed.
2. **Set up Environment Variables:**  Set the ANDROID_HOME environment variable to point to the directory where your Android SDK is installed.  Also set JAVA_HOME to the directory where your JDK is installed. For example:
   ```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/your/android/sdk
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk
```
3. **Clean and Rebuild:** Try cleaning your project and rebuilding the APK:
   ```bash
expo prebuild --clean
expo build:android
```
4. **Check for Conflicts:** Make sure you don't have conflicting versions of Android build tools or other SDK components.
5. **Consult Expo Documentation:** For the most current troubleshooting, refer to the official Expo documentation.
